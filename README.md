// To implement the project, I used the same function declarations and elevators&users structure definitions but I modified,and added 
// new functionality such as  inputting users destinations, randomly selecting the users from floors, initializing the elevators, structures, used barriers instead of conditional mutex variables, controlling the time using sleep functions,  and simulating the elevators while using print statements.

# How to Run The Project

// To run the code on the terminal >gcc -pthread form.c -o form \
// To process the exe file generated by the first command >./form
