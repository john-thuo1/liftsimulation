These are the references I used to do this assignment.I acknowledge that not all of the code used in this assignment was originally developed by me. \  
Some function declarations  such as elevator ready and user request are a modification of existing code fetched from the attached resources.\

To implement the project, I used the same function declarations and elevators&users structure definitions but I modified,and added 
new functionality such as  inputting users destinations, randomly selecting the users from floors, initializing the elevators, structures, used barriers instead of conditional mutex variables, controlling the time using sleep functions,  and simulating the elevators while using print statements.

# How to Run The Project

// To run the code on the terminal >gcc -pthread form.c -o form \
// To process the exe file generated by the first command >./form
# Input required by the Program
// At the start of the program, you are required to enter the destinations of the 10 users of the elevators. \
    An example of a valid input = 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 2 3 1 . This translates to array[FLOORS] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,2,3,1]
    It means:\
          User 0 requesting an elevator to floor 1,\
          User 1 requesting an elevator to floor 2,\
          User 2 requesting an elevator to floor 3,\
          User 3 requesting an elevator to floor 4,\
          User n requesting an elevator to floor L,\
          
          And so on.\
    Ground Floor = 0, and the other floors are numbered 1 to 7. In total, there are 8 floors in the building.\n
 // The elevators can go down upto Ground Floor and Up, upto 7nth Floor.
